#Source code of our CoPINN-RE.

#CoPINN-RE is a novel framework for simulating flow in roughness-free channels and for roughness inversion.

#We recommend running the code using Docker.Moreover, taking Case 1 as an example, the steps for rapidly running through the code are provided.

##Steps
Step 1: ensure that Docker Desktop is installed. 

Step 2: Build a Docker image . Enter the following command in the command line:
docker build -t copinn-re:latest . 

Step 3: Use the following code to run the training: 
docker run -it --rm --gpus all -v D:/pyproject/CoPINN-RE/data:/app/data -v D:/pyproject/CoPINN-RE/results/case1:/app/results copinn-re:latest python -m src.main
